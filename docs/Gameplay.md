# The basics
EARLY GAME DESIGN STAGE, EVERYTHING CAN BE CHANGED!

The game will be a roguelike, twin stick shooter with RPG elements. The player will observe the events from above. The game will be clearly split into two distinct elements: combat and navigating a semi-open world.

## Combat
The fight takes place in randomly generated rooms. The player plays the commander. WSAD walking, mouse aiming. The player has the option to directly aim the commander. You left-click to fire a weapon or use a skill that is selected from the CTRL selection wheel. He gives commands to the team with the right mouse button. The command type is selected from the second ALT selection wheel. Hiding behind covers will be an important element of the game.

The game is to be designed in such a way that on higher difficulty levels it is impossible to move on without harmonious coordination between giving orders and fighting. A lot of rubbish is also raised in the rooms, which can be exchanged in safe zones and open world for upgrades for the commander and team.

The last sequence is a mini-boss fight in a specially designed room. After defeating the boss, in this room you will be able to find a story item or a conversation, if the fight was part of the main or side quest.

Room types:
* Standard room: Randomly generated obstacles and covers, lots of enemies.
* Riddle room: Little or no opponents, an environmental puzzle designed by the developers.
* Hiding place room: A room with a valuable find. Mostly the entrance through a hidden passage, sometimes through a normal passage.
* Boss room: Entirely designed by developers, tailored to suit the boss.
* Safe zone: Room without enemies, inhabited by friendly monsters, that is, civilians of the underworld.

## Open World
The navigating a open world is not an important part of the gameplay, but it's very important for narrative. In open world the player will get to know the game world, characters and events. The open world is not made up of rooms, but is one larger location, sometimes it will be underground cities, sometimes it will be an underground clearing, etc. In this part of the game, the player moves without a team (except for some main quests)

The open world isn't one big location, but it's devided into smaller fragments. After leaving the location, you will not be able to return to it. In open world section the player will be able to get to know the main and side characters, accept an additional tasks, talk to the NPCs, and improve the commander's and team's equipment. 

The open world is largely a safe zone inhabited by friendly monsters, but you can find thugs or military bases that start fighting in the open world. The fight with thugs is simple and not complicated, but due to the fact that in an open world the commander moves without a team, defeating the entire military base is extremely demanding.
